# Telemanga

Telemanga is basically built to provide mangas in PDF format through telegram. 
It currently only supports 1 scraper service through [MangaFox](https://www.mangafox.win)

Telemanga is currently in **alpha** and is prone to *lots of bugs*. If you happen to find any
please raise an issue on the github repository.

The bot may be accessed [here](https://t.me/telemangabot)

## Motivation

Simply for convenience. Skip all the ads and the bad apps and simply just read it natively
on your phone's PDF viewer. This is mainly to aid our fellow iPhone users who do not have access to 
Tachiyomi. :(

## Contributing

Implementation structure is still quite volatile. When it is finally fixed and stabilised,
a contributing guide to adding more sources for the scrapers will be added.
